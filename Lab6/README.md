## Lab 6: VHDL Code for Combinational Circuits: Code Converter

## Objective
To design and simulate a BCD-to-Excess-3 code converter in VHDL.
To design and simulate a Binary-to-Gray code converter in VHDL.

## Theory
## BCD to Excess-3
Excess-3 (XS-3) is a non-weighted BCD code obtained by adding 3 (0011) to each BCD digit. It is self-complementing, making it useful in arithmetic circuits.

Decimal	   BCD(DCBA)	Excess-3 (WXYZ)
0	         0000	      0011
1	         0001	      0100
2	         0010	      0101
3	         0011	      0110
4	         0100	      0111
5	         0101	      1000
6	         0110	      1001
7            0111	      1010
8	         1000	      1011
9	         1001	      1100

## Binary to Gray Code
Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ by only one bit. It is widely used in rotary encoders and error minimization.

The conversion rule: 
Gi=Bi⊕Bi+1(MSB of Gray = MSB of Binary).

|Decimal	|   Binary(DCBA)	|    Gray Code (WXYZ)|

|0	        |    0000	        |      0000          |
|1	        |    0001	        |      0001          |
|2	        |    0010	        |      0010          |
|3	        |    0011	        |      0010          |
|4	        |    0100	        |      0110          |
|5	        |    0101	        |       0111         |
|6	        |    0110	        |       0101         |
|7	        |    0111	        |       0100         |
|8	        |    1000	        |       1100         |
|9	        |    1001	        |       1101         |

## Discussion and Conclusion:
This lab successfully verified the design and simulation of a BCD-to-Excess-3 converter and a Binary-to-Gray code converter using VHDL, GHDL, and GTKWave. The BCD-to-Excess-3 module correctly added a binary 3(0011) to the inputs, confirming its function for arithmetic operations. The Binary-to-Gray module successfully implemented concurrent XOR logic (Gi=Bi+1⊕Bi) to produce a unit-distance output where only one bit changes at a time. The final waveforms matched our expected truth tables perfectly, validating that both combinational circuits are logically correct and demonstrating how alternative coding formats efficiently eliminate timing hazards and optimize digital hardware.
