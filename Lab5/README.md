## Lab Report: 2-bit Magnitude Comparator


## Objective
To design and simulate a 2-bit magnitude comparator in VHDL.
To understand how comparison operations are implemented in hardware.


## Theory
A magnitude comparator compares two binary numbers and produces three output signals:

EQ (Equal): HIGH when 
A=B
GT (Greater Than):HIGH when A>B
LT (Less Than): HIGH when A<B
For a 2-bit comparator with inputs A=A1A0 and 
B=B1B0:
EQ=A1⊕B1―⋅A0⊕B0―
GT=A1B1―+A1⊕B1―⋅A0B0
LT=A1―B1+A1⊕B1―⋅A0―B0

## Output

## Discussion and conclusion
Here, by the waveform we verify that a comparator has place for 2 input and 3 output lines, the comparator is a device that compares the two inputs and gives an output as high in one of the 3 output lines. The two inputs A and B determine the output eq, lt and gt, eq = 1 when A=B, gt = 1 when A > B and lt = 1 when A < B.
